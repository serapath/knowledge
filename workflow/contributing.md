# collaborators (co-owners)

# rules of contributing?

other "participation hacks" from that session included:

a CONTRIBUTING.md that lays out how to participate, whether the maintainers have time and desire to specifically help new programmers or people from marginalized groups, etc.
"open open source" distributes ownership (and ownership can increase motivation)
"help wanted" labels for new contributors help contributors find good pieces for a first contribution
smilies/emoji/links to process documentation can help new contributors not get scared away by tone of critical feedback ("please rebase this." vs. "almost there, just needs a rebase first :)")
