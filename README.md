# notes
a place to keep some notes

* I brainstorm using gists https://gist.github.com/serapath
* I put stuff here once i'm more sure about it.

# you :-)
If you stumble upon this repository and actually read stuff, please feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/serapath/notebook/issues) and give me some feedback.
* I'm especially interested in help to improve my notes
* Any other kind of feedback or questions is welcome too :-)

thx.
